# Version Bump

Bump the versions embedded in different files of the project.
This is run without needing a cloud hosted Git repo for a SaaS to submit PRs.
This works with versions embedded in scripts, Makefiles, config files, yaml, Dockerfiles, any text file where you can find the version with a regular expression.
